[00:09:23]: <== ══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY RENDERING LIBRARY ╞═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
[00:09:23]: <== The following assertion was thrown during layout:
[00:09:23]: <== A RenderFlex overflowed by 18 pixels on the right.
[00:09:23]: <== The relevant error-causing widget was:
[00:09:23]: <==   Row Row:file:///D:/Flutter/buoi1/lib/contact/listchat.dart:111:22
[00:09:23]: <== The overflowing RenderFlex has an orientation of Axis.horizontal.
[00:09:23]: <== The edge of the RenderFlex that is overflowing has been marked in the rendering with a yellow and
[00:09:23]: <== black striped pattern. This is usually caused by the contents being too big for the RenderFlex.
[00:09:23]: <== Consider applying a flex factor (e.g. using an Expanded widget) to force the children of the
[00:09:23]: <== RenderFlex to fit within the available space instead of being sized to their natural size.
[00:09:23]: <== This is considered an error condition because it indicates that there is content that cannot be
[00:09:23]: <== seen. If the content is legitimately bigger than the available space, consider clipping it with a
[00:09:23]: <== ClipRect widget before putting it in the flex, or using a scrollable container rather than a Flex,
[00:09:23]: <== like a ListView.
[00:09:23]: <== The specific RenderFlex in question is: RenderFlex#2c771 relayoutBoundary=up1 OVERFLOWING:
[00:09:23]: <==   creator: Row ← Center ← Padding ← DecoratedBox ← ConstrainedBox ← Padding ← Container ←
